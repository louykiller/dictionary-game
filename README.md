# Game Rules
1ยบ Choose a base word with a minimum of 4 letters

2ยบ Try to guess as many words as possible that can be written with the letters of the base word

3ยบ You only have 3 lives! If you write an invalid or non-existent word you loose a life

# Game Example
Base Word: parent

Correct Guesses: part, net, pet, tap

Wrong Guesses: partner (the base word only has 1 letter 'r' and not 2), dog (the base word has none of those letters), tnerap (word doesn't exist)

# Language
The game can only be played in english for now. Portuguese will be added later. 

The structure of the web page will be the same for the 2 languages but the database for the words is (obviously) different.

# TODO
- Make the UI better (create an event listener to check the word after pressing Enter, make the guesses list more robust, try to make the website phone friendly)
- Organize the code better
- Portuguese Version

# More Ideas
- Add a sugestion feature, where if a player makes a guess that's not in the valid words list, and would be correct with the current base word, the player can sugest a new word along with an example of the word (e.g Word - lol, example - acronym for laughing out loud (LOL))
